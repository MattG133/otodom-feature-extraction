# Extracting Features from Listings Descriptions

This project is aimed at extracting as many useful features from both sales and rent listings obtained using the Otodom scraper from my other repo, [otodom_listings_scrapy](https://github.com/yourusername/otodom_listings_scrapy). This is being done for the following reasons:

- To potentially fill missing values (many listings have information in the description which should also be in the listings' properties but isn't).
- To equalize features between rent and sale datasets to make machine learning exercises possible (e.g., predicting rent and ROI).
- To make use of the description feature.

The feature extraction process will be conducted using text processing methods and classification models.

## Table of Contents

- [data (folder)](#data-folder) - contains data scraped using otodom-listings-scraper (see my other repo).
- [extract_features.ipynb](#extract_featuresipynb) - Jupyter notebook with analysis and modeling trials (will be a base for a future script and later a pipeline).

## Usage

- Currently under development.
